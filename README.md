# Audio-MNIST-Digit-Recognition
The objective here is to build an Artificial Neural Network that can look at Mel or MFCC spectrograms of audio files and classify them into 10 classes. The audio files are recordings of different speakers uttering a particular digit and the corresponding class to be predicted is the digit itself.
